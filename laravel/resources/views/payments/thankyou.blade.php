                                <p>The annual process of creating CMG’s World Color Forecast™ starts with pre-summit meetings. Traveling the world to trade events, taking in the cultural shifts, scientific discoveries, technology advances, and global changes, our color design professionals gather the research for color and trend discussions that ultimately guide our CMG World Color Forecast™ two years ahead of the markets.</p><p> Each year CMG holds ChromaZones® to discuss and reveal the research and stories that support the forecasted colors. During these global color forecasting meetings color design professionals share concentrated information that is fundamental to the final forecasted color directions. This information is available to the attendees of the ChromaZones® and also moves onto the final World Color Forecast™ colors, steered annually each September. </p>

                                <p>Three global conferences are held annually  in Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. Color and trend forecast discussions from these conference attendees is steered into the European, Asia Pacific, and Latin American Color Forecasts which are combined with the North American Color Forecast to create the final 64 color CMG World Color Forecast™. </p>

                                <p>Each November the CMG International Summit reveals the World Color Forecast™ colors and the supporting final reports. The Summit holds Color Application Workshops to further discuss the mixed industry use of the CMG World Color Forecast color evolution, combinations and product applications. The results of these workshops (Colors in Action, Contract Colors, CMG Group, and World Colors) are presented at the Summit and are offered online.</p>
